# The_economy_forecaster

Post COVID-19 the demands of various commodities will take a major hit in the world market. The GDP of even USA will suffer greatly which is said to have the strongest economy. The economists clearly mentioned that the demand for non -essential goods will go down but at the same time the demand of the essential items such as food grains, pharmaceuticals etc. will go up.
Our program with help of machine learning predicts the demands of various food grains and other essential items in global market. This will help the Indian producers to boost the production of those items which are in demand. Thus, we can increase our export and boost our economy.
We have used the ARIMA model, PYTHON language, WEB development, Watson assistant to complete this project.
